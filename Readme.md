# Portfolio of Avinash

## Introduction

Hey! 👋 I’m Avinash (not that you couldn’t already tell from the repo name).  
This repo holds my portfolio - basically a place where I dumped my skills, experience, and random bits about me in one spot.

It’s live here → [davinash97.xyz](https://davinash97.xyz)

Go check it out if you want. Feedback, roast, constructive criticism — all welcome.

## What makes this _special_?

Honestly? Nothing groundbreaking. I just started building it one day and kept adding whatever came to mind.  
Might be slightly over-engineered in places… but hey, that’s subjective.

Here’s what I actually did though:

-   Practiced the good old **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle
-   Naming conventions: `camelCase` for functions, `SCREAMING_CASE` for constants, and normal case for variables
-   Kept [data](src/app/data) separate instead of hardcoding things like a rookie
-   Offloaded data loading to a [web worker](src/app/worker/LoadData.ts) so the main thread chills
-   Broke stuff into reusable [components](src/app/components/) (future me will thank me)
-   Contact form works (limited to 3 mails/hour because people on the internet can’t be trusted 🙃)
-   Custom domain with SSL/TLS - so yes, it’s **https** like a civilized site
-   Sprinkled some framer-motion for subtle animations
-   TailwindCSS for styling (because writing raw CSS is pain)
-   TypeScript, because types save lives
-   Next.js - because React alone wasn’t enough pain
-   Deployed on Netlify (easy button for hosting)
-   Auto Day/Night mode (according to your Operating System's Preference)

## Final note

At the end of the day, it’s “just another portfolio.”  
But it’s my space on the internet - built with some love, some overthinking, and a lot of coffee. ☕
